### A coding-agent runtime for real engineering work

> **Tianshu** is a TypeScript coding-agent runtime: one agent kernel shared by a **terminal TUI** and a **desktop GUI**. It is built to let models do continuous multi-step engineering work — with cognitive guardrails, multi-agent orchestration, and a DeepSeek V4 prefix-cache-friendly design for cost-efficient long sessions.

- **One kernel, two surfaces** — a pure-ANSI terminal TUI (`tianshu`) and a Tauri desktop app (macOS / Windows / Linux) share the same agent core, so capabilities stay consistent across interfaces.
- **Cognitive Virtual Machine (CVM)** — 72 runtime hooks across 5 lifecycle phases put an observable, correctable cognitive layer between model output and real tool actions ([A/B evidence](docs/CVM运行时对Agent模型的实证影响.md)).
- **Multi-agent orchestration** — from lightweight `/scout` reconnaissance and parallel `/team` execution to `/council` multi-model review and `/galaxy` multi-dimensional attack, complex work runs in waves with review gates.
- **Unified project memory** — project knowledge lives in `.rivet/knowledge/memory.jsonl`; automatic injection is limited to governance/constraint/preference memories, while old failures and docs stay explicit-recall-only so they cannot hijack new questions.
- **Prefix-cache first** — frozen prefix + incremental appendix + boundary compaction sustain a measured steady-state **95–99% prefix-cache hit rate** on DeepSeek V4.

## Why Tianshu?

### The starting point: models didn't get dumber — training "optimized" abilities away

In real engineering sessions we kept observing the same model weights regress — not bugs, but **structural degradation left by the transformer attention mechanism and RLHF reward training**:

| Degradation | Symptom | Training source |
|-------------|---------|-----------------|
| **Surrender protocol** | Concedes the moment it's challenged; first reflex is "you're right" | RLHF: obedience scores high, pushback scores low |
| **Causal collapse** | Output n-gram overlap reaches 80%; the model collapses into self-similar loops | transformer attention mechanics |
| **Attention lock-in** | New scene, same answer (directed-scout isomorphism 1.0) | attention anchored to early tokens |
| **Information barrier** | The protagonist datum is the dominant anchor and eats the entire attention budget | attention decay over distance |
| **Knowing ≠ doing** | Corrections don't persist across sessions — write the lesson in the prompt, the next session repeats the mistake | no runtime state |

Questioning, verifying, refusing, self-reflection — these abilities were always in the model; training suppressed them. The question Tianshu answers: **can we recover them from training bias without touching the weights?**

### The evidence: A/B control, not vibes

On 2026-05-19, the same model (DeepSeek-V4-Flash), the same 5 tasks, the only variable being the CVM runtime switch (`STAR_SOUL=0/1`), reviewed by Claude Opus 4.7:

| Metric | Group A (no CVM) | Group B (CVM) |
|--------|------------------|---------------|
| Task completion | 4/5 | **5/5** |
| Proactively raised objections | 0/5 | **3/5** |
| Proactively asked about scope / impact | 0/5 | **1/5** |
| System-impact awareness (cache-invalidation warning) | 0/5 | **1/5** |
| Intent understanding > literal execution | 1/5 | **4/5** |

The most valuable data point is T4: facing the "file already exists" contradiction, Group A wrote a 196-line retrospective and refused to act, while Group B read the user's real intent and shipped +162/-20 lines of working code — **same weights, opposite reactions**. A retrospective is not a delivery.

The conclusion is precise: the boost is real and observable, but bounded (convictions hold in the analysis/suggestion phase and decay at the confirm/execute boundary — which became the exact target of the next iteration). **Zero extra inference cost**: prompt-layer conviction injection plus hook-layer runtime interception produced observable behavioral gains on the cheapest open model. Full data and per-task comparisons: [CVM Empirical Report](docs/CVM运行时对Agent模型的实证影响.md).

### The answer: the Cognitive Virtual Machine (CVM) — map each degradation back to its training source and intercept at runtime

CVM doesn't make the model "smarter"; it adds four layers of defense in depth:

```
Layer 1: Belief constitution (static prompt)  → "you should question, verify, refuse"   [A/B proven]
Layer 2: Courage Hook (preTurn)               → encourage independent judgment          [A/B proven]
Layer 3: Sensorium (per turn, <1ms)           → 6-dim state sensing drives strategy      [Wave 7-8 proven]
Layer 4: RuntimeHookPipeline (72 hooks)       → trap-and-emulate regressed behaviors     [always on]
```

### Task Modes: different ways of working, same model

A task mode (formerly "star domain"; command `/task-mode`, `/domain` still works as a legacy alias) is an optional switch in how the agent works. It is not role-play — switching really changes the **system prompt**, the **tool whitelist**, and the **decision threshold**, so the same model behaves consistently differently between "plan first" and "act first". A task mode never reduces capability: every mode can complete a full task; what differs is what it looks at first and in what order.

**16 task modes (display name · when to use · how it works):**

| Display name | When to use | How it works |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Project orchestration** `tianshu` | The task spans several modules and someone must hold the global picture | Fix the global structure and contracts first, then dispatch and review; re-check the goal at every step |
| **Exploring new approaches** `pojun` | Direction is unclear and no existing path applies | Try several routes in parallel, discard fast, keep the one that runs |
| **Maintaining structure** `tianfu` | Touching old code where breaking an existing contract is a risk | Read callers and structure first, confirm boundaries before changing, fail loudly on ambiguity |
| **Executing tasks** `tianliang` | The plan is settled and needs to land | Execute in waves, verify after each wave, leave a trail on delivery |
| **Evaluating approaches** `tianquan` | Choosing among several designs | Read the code before planning, lay out trade-offs and costs, produce an executable plan |
| **Checking premises** `tianji` | The plan looks right but nobody has checked its assumptions | Challenge each assumption, deduct failure modes, look for gaps at the edges |
| **Cross-module analysis** `tianxuan` | Stuck against a hard boundary, debugging in circles | Change viewpoint, look for isomorphs in unrelated fields, return to the root cause |
| **Optimizing prompts** `fu` | Agent behavior falls short, or the prompt needs work | Diagnose where behavior drifts, distill the method, change the prompt and re-measure |
| **Tidying code** `wenqu` | Code works but is hard to read | Unify naming and structure, improve readability and code feel |
| **Verifying runtime results** `kaiyang` | Performance concerns, or results look suspicious | Measure before concluding: instrumented reconciliation, simulation replay, quantified localization |
| **Reproducing and verifying** `yaoguang` | Someone claims "fixed" or "tests pass" | Reproduce independently; trust no claim — a green light is not proof, reproduction is |
| **Following long-running work** `huagai` | Work spans many rounds and must keep moving | Hold baseline and cadence, reconcile progress each round, never stop half way |
| **Everyday development** `qiming` | Ordinary request, direction basically clear (default mode) | See the whole picture and the blast radius first, then fix the root cause |
| **Checking UI and delivery** `changgeng` | Frontend changes that must be looked at to be believed | Final visual check: screenshot diffing, interaction walkthrough, item-by-item before delivery |
| **Trimming redundancy** `qisha` | Too much unnecessary material in code or output | Delete dead code and excess, cut the attention budget, prove before deleting |
| **Using the minimal toolset** `taiyi` | You want quiet efficiency without tool noise (manual switch) | Assemble only high-frequency core tools, move in small steps, never nag |

```bash
/task-mode tianliang       # switch to "Executing tasks"
/task-mode list            # list all modes
/task-mode                 # open the mode picker
/domain tianliang          # legacy alias, still works
```

New sessions default to **Everyday development**. Setting the default mode to `auto` enables keyword-based routing from the task description. Full details: [User guide — Task Modes](docs/user-guide.md#任务模式).

### Engineering Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| CLI source (TypeScript, excl. tests) | 1,078 files / 257,623 lines |
| Test code | 1,361 files / 256,001 lines |
| Test cases (node:test, static declarations) | **16,471**, test : source ≈ **0.99 : 1** |
| Total commits | **6,178** on main (repo created 2026-05-15, 105 days in) |
| Type checking | `tsc` strict + `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` |
| Prefix-cache hit rate | 95–99% steady state, measured on long sessions |

Agent core logic (multi-turn loops, tool pipelines, context compaction) is notoriously hard to test, and most open-source agents ship with thin coverage. This project maintains a near 1:1 test-to-source ratio, and every incident fix ships with a regression test — the ratio has held between 0.93:1 and 0.99:1 as the codebase grew (the table above is a measured snapshot as of 2026-08-28). Full methodology, growth milestones, and reproduction commands: [Engineering Metrics](docs/engineering-metrics.md).

### Tianshu vs. MiMo-Code vs. Claude Code

> The table reflects each project's publicly documented focus at the time of writing. "—" means the capability is not a publicly highlighted feature, not necessarily that it is absent. Corrections welcome via issue/PR.

| Dimension | Tianshu | MiMo-Code | Claude Code |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core focus** | Cognitive runtime (CVM) | Product experience / ecosystem | Enterprise coding agent |
| **Runtime hook layer** | 72 conditionally-assembled hook modules × 5 phases | standard agent loop | user-configurable hooks |

## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

- **Node.js ≥ 24** (pinned in `engines`) — required to run Tianshu. Verify with `node --version`. Lower versions only warn during install but are unsupported; the one-line installer checks and stops with an upgrade hint.
- **Git** — optional but strongly recommended. Without it Tianshu still runs (agents
  work in-place), but git unlocks delegated worktree isolation, checkpoint rollback,
  `commit`/`diff` review, and per-worker diff review. Install: <https://git-scm.com/downloads>.

### 2. Install (pick one)

**A. Desktop app (ready to use)** — download from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/huiliyi37/Tianshu-harness/releases/latest): macOS `.dmg` (Apple Silicon / Intel) · Windows `.exe` setup wizard · Linux `.AppImage`.
> **Linux support scope (new in 3.11.2)**: x64 AppImage, no install needed — `chmod +x Tianshu_*.AppImage` and run; requires glibc ≥ 2.35 (Ubuntu 22.04+ / Debian 12+ and other mainstream distros); X11 recommended (Wayland untested). Known limitation: voice input is unavailable on Linux for now (no community whisper build — falls back to browser speech); desktop auto-update works on Linux too.

**B. One-line installer (recommended)** — checks Node ≥ 24 → installs `tianshu-harness` globally (npmmirror registry by default; override via `NPM_CONFIG_REGISTRY`) → launches `tianshu`; idempotent, safe to re-run:

```bash
# macOS / Linux (bash)
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huiliyi37/Tianshu-harness/main/scripts/install-tui.sh)
# install without launching:
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huiliyi37/Tianshu-harness/main/scripts/install-tui.sh) --no-launch

# Windows (PowerShell)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huiliyi37/Tianshu-harness/main/scripts/install-tui.ps1 | iex"
# install without launching (after cloning the repo):
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\install-tui.ps1 -NoLaunch
```

**C. npm manual install (for the CLI)** — published as `tianshu-harness`, no local build needed, with auto update checks on startup:

```bash
npm install -g tianshu-harness
tianshu
```

> **Migrating from the old `tianshu-tui` package**: the old package owns the `rivet` bin link, so a direct install fails with `EEXIST` — uninstall first: `npm uninstall -g tianshu-tui && npm install -g tianshu-harness` (the one-line installer handles this automatically).

**D. Build from source**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/huiliyi37/Tianshu-harness.git
cd Tianshu-harness
npm install
npm run build      # produces dist/cli/entry.js
npm start          # or: node dist/cli/entry.js
```

### 3. Configure an API Key

**No manual step needed for installed builds** — the first launch walks you through it: the desktop app opens a connection wizard, and the CLI auto-runs a setup wizard when no key is found. Just paste your DeepSeek key. Change it anytime: Settings → Provider on desktop, `tianshu config` on the CLI.

**Manual configuration** is only for developers running from source (or pre-seeding a setup):

```bash
tianshu config set-key deepseek sk-xxx   # key goes to secrets.json (0600); config.json keeps only a keyRef
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-xxx         # or: environment variable (current shell only)
```

> Other providers (Claude, GLM, Codex, MiniMax, MiMo) use the same pattern. See
> [Provider Config](docs/user-guide-provider-config.md).

### 4. Launch

```bash
tianshu            # or: npm start / node dist/cli/entry.js
```

You should see the TUI with a `〉` prompt. Type your request and press Enter.

### Your first task

Start with a **read-only** pass so it can learn your project (nothing gets modified):

```
Read this project and tell me its structure, where the entry points are, and one thing most worth improving
```

Once you trust its reading, give it a **multi-step task**:

```
Fix the first failing test in this project and explain the root cause
```

From there it greps, reads files, edits code and runs tests on its own — every step shows up as a tool call, nothing is just claimed. The default approval tier is **Approve for me**: low-risk actions run directly, high-risk ones stop and ask (see [Approval & Permissions](#approval--permissions)).

### What to look at afterwards

**① Delivery report** — when the run wraps up, Tianshu calls `deliver_task` and prints a delivery report: gate state (GREEN / YELLOW / RED), which files changed, which verifications ran, and a per-item completion audit. "Done" requires evidence; a finish without evidence gets blocked by the gate.

**② Cockpit** — type `/cockpit` to open it (also reachable from the `Ctrl+P` command palette):

| Panel | What it shows |
|-------|---------------|
| `/cockpit verify` | Delivery verification: verified / unverified / failed / blocked, which commands ran, blast radius |
| `/cockpit advisory` | Runtime advisory ledger: rendered / adopted / ignored, plus per-key adoption rate and lift |
| `/cockpit model` | Cache hit rate, input/output tokens, per-turn cost |
| `/cockpit safety` | Risk level and doom-loop detection |

No argument gives the summary view; `/cockpit off` closes it.

### Headless mode (script integration)

```bash
tianshu -p "explain src/agent/loop.ts"       # one-shot prompt, text output, no TUI
tianshu -p "list all TODO comments" --json   # JSON output for scripting
tianshu --stream-json -p "refactor this module"   # NDJSON event stream: text_delta/tool_use/tool_result/turn_complete… (best for CI; output is auto-redacted)
tianshu --goal "fix all type errors" --budget 50  # headless goal autonomy, max 50 turns (default 100)
```

### Command-line flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-p <prompt>` `--print <prompt>` | One-shot prompt; exits after text output (exit code: 0 success / 1 failure) |
| `--json` | With `-p`, emits a single JSON result |
| `--stream-json` | NDJSON event stream (`text_delta` / `tool_use` / `tool_result` / `worker` / `turn_complete` / `result`); output is auto-redacted, ideal for CI |
| `--goal "<task>"` | Headless goal autonomy; runs until the goal is met or `--budget` is exhausted |
| `--budget <N>` | Turn budget for goal mode (default 100) |
| `--model <name>` | Override the model for this session |
| `--provider <name>` | Override the provider for this session |
| `--continue` `-c` | Resume the most recent session for this cwd |
| `--resume <id\|prefix>` `-r <id\|prefix>` | Resume a specific session (short prefix OK) |
| `--resume` `-r` (bare) | Open the session picker after startup |
| `--new` | Force a brand-new session |
| `--list` · `tianshu sessions` | Print the session list and exit |
| `--dangerously-skip-permissions` | One-session Full access (skip all approvals; existing deny rules still apply) |
| `--screen-reader` | Screen-reader mode (dynamic segments not rendered; periodic redraw halted) |
| `--skip-welcome` | Skip the welcome screen |
| `--stream-events <path>` | Mirror this run as NDJSON `SessionEvent`s to a file |

Subcommands: `tianshu config` (interactive config), `tianshu serve` (sidecar HTTP/SSE server), `tianshu sessions` (list sessions), `tianshu logs` (log locations), `tianshu browser status` / `tianshu browser install [--no-mirror]` (chromium health check and one-shot install for `browser_debug`; mirrors by default).

### Auto-Update

When installed via npm, Tianshu checks for newer versions at startup (once per 24h)
and shows a banner. `/update` runs `npm install -g tianshu-harness@latest` and restarts.
Source installs use `git pull && npm install && npm run build`. Suppress the check
with `RIVET_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`.

## Core Features

### Prefix Cache Engine

DeepSeek charges 50× more for cache misses. Tianshu's prompt engine is built around prefix-cache friendliness:

- **Frozen prefix** — System prompt + tool definitions + stable context are frozen at session start and not rewritten within a session, so subsequent requests tend to hit the cache.
- **Delta appendix** — Dynamic context (progress, advisories, signals) is injected as a cross-turn diff append-only block, never rewriting prior messages. Turn-to-turn delta is ~200 bytes vs ~5KB full rewrite.
- **Read-ref dedup** — Repeated reads of unchanged files return a compact reference instead of re-emitting full content.
- **Cache-aware compaction** — Compaction preserves the first 2 messages as cache anchor.
- **Resume cache inheritance** — The frozen prefix snapshot is persisted to disk (every user boundary + on shutdown); on resume it is read back and fed to the new engine, avoiding a byte-0 full miss. Falls back to full rebuild only when there is no snapshot, the file is corrupt, or the provider cache has expired.
- **Diagnostics** — `/debug cache` shows hit rate, miss reason analysis, and per-turn cache history.
- **Peak/off-peak pricing indicator** — DeepSeek's official off-peak half pricing (peak = Beijing time weekdays 9:00–12:00 / 14:00–18:00; everything else half price): both the TUI status bar and the desktop Composer show a `◷闲½` / `◷峰` badge with a countdown to the next transition in the tooltip. Shown only for the official DeepSeek provider; zero configuration.

Real-world hit rate: 95–99% steady state on long sessions. This is not "every request hits" — the cache can fragment at certain boundaries (see below). Per-request logs from real engineering sessions (5 sessions, 2,001 requests, 645M input tokens, bill cut from ¥880 to ¥20) with reproduction commands: [Observability Harness](docs/reference/observability-harness.md).

#### Cache fragmentation & troubleshooting

High hit rates depend on a byte-stable prefix. The cache will miss — showing `cache_read_input_tokens` stuck at 0 every turn — when:

- **System prompt / tool definitions change** — tools or prompt layers change mid-session (e.g. switching task mode, adding/removing a skill; Zen Mode promotion is a deliberate one-time instance — see "Zen Mode" below)
- **Model switch** — different models have different cache keys; switching models rebuilds from 0
- **Byte-level drift** — message content contains unstable bytes like timestamps or random IDs
- **Cross-boundary rewrites** — `/compact` (only rewrites history at `turn===0`), `/cd` (breaks the prefix tail at the new user boundary)

To troubleshoot: ① confirm the data dir (desktop Settings → Storage, or `echo $RIVET_HOME`); ② open the session `.jsonl` and search `cache_read_input_tokens` to inspect each turn; ③ enable `RIVET_DEBUG_TELEMETRY=1` and inspect the `recall-summary` events in `sensorium.jsonl`; ④ run `npm exec -- tsx scripts/verify-cache-hit-rate.ts` to simulate a multi-turn conversation. Full details in the project's `AGENTS.md` "Cache troubleshooting" section.

### Zen Mode: read-focused start, unlock on first write

New sessions start by default with a narrowed read-only tool face (`read_file` / `grep` / `glob` / `repo_map` + the `zen_unlock` declaration tool), so the model is not distracted by the full tool schemas and dynamic injections at the start. When the task turns hands-on, calling an out-of-face tool or `zen_unlock` promotes the session to the full face and lets the call through — no refusal, no extra round-trip. Worker/subagent sessions never enter zen (their tool face is decided by the delegator).

Promotion channels (zen → full, one-way, at most once per session):

- **triage** — a first message that is single-line and ≤80 chars is treated as trivial and promoted before the very first request: **zero cache break** (the narrowed face never goes on the wire)
- **tool** — calling an out-of-face tool or `zen_unlock` during the zen phase: promotes immediately and lets the call through (mid-turn)
- **timeout** — auto-promotes after 8 user turns without hands-on action
- **`/fast`** — manual user skip

**Prefix-cache impact (why the cache "breaks" once in a while)**: at promotion, the request's `tools` field jumps from ~5 definitions back to the full face — a prefix-identity change on par with the system prompt, so that one request rebuilds the whole prefix (measured shape: the hit rate dips on the promotion turn, then returns to the 99% steady state on the very next turn). The system prompt, frozen prefix, message history, and model never change; the zen phase's trimming of dynamic injections (appendixLean) happens in the appendix *after* the prefix, with zero cache damage. Observability: the session `meta.json` persists `zenPhase` / `zenPromoteReason`, and the `toolsUpdated` event on the promotion turn in `cache-log.jsonl` marks the breakpoint. Triage already spares most trivial sessions from even this single break; to disable entirely:

```json
// ~/.rivet/config.json or project .rivet-config.json
{ "tools": { "zen": { "enabled": false } } }
```

Optional knobs: `faceMode: "structuredRead"` (adds `file_info` / `related_tests` / `repo_graph` / `semantic_search` / `read_section` to the read face), `timeoutSteps` (0 disables timeout promotion), `triage.maxChars`, `appendixLean`.

> Note: the desktop shortcut `⌘/Ctrl+.` "Zen mode" is a pure UI focus mode (hides the sidebar) — same name, different feature, zero cache impact.

### Subagent Orchestration

Delegate sub-tasks to independent headless worker sessions:

- **Typed work orders** — code_search, review, verify, patch_proposal, plan
- **Tool isolation** — read-only workers (scout) vs write workers (patcher)
- **Adaptive model routing** — Per-profile pass-rate + latency scoring auto-selects the best model per task type
- **Batch dispatch** — Multiple work orders run concurrently with 5 aggregation policies
- **Team orchestration** — Plan → wave-based parallel execution with file-conflict-aware scheduling
- **Process isolation (optional)** — with `RIVET_WORKER_ISOLATION=1`, each dispatch runs in its own subprocess (stdio NDJSON protocol + watchdog kill ladder); in-process by default

### Toolset & presets

Tianshu ships 50 built-in tools, assembled in preset tiers (resolution priority: `RIVET_TOOL_PRESET` env > project `.rivet-config.json` `tools.preset` > per-domain overrides (`runtime.domains.<domain>.toolPreset`) > the mode's built-in tier (taiyi mode → taiyi) > default `frontend`):

| Preset | Tools | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **minimal** | 29 | Full daily-dev capability — read/write/search/bash/git/tests/delegation/web/plan/todo/memory; saves tokens, preserves prefix cache |
| **frontend** (default) | 30 | minimal + `browser_debug` (UI rendering verification loop) |
| **full** | 50 | Everything — `council_convene` / `team_orchestrate` / `attack_case` / `semantic_search` / `repo_graph` / `monitor` / `computer_use` / `capability` / `cli_discover` / office tools, etc. |
| **taiyi** | 16 | Minimal evaluation tier — high-frequency core + delivery loop, without orchestration/browser/network/vision heavyweights; auto-applies when the taiyi task mode is pinned (explicit config always wins) |

```bash
RIVET_TOOL_PRESET=full tianshu          # use full for this session
```

```json
{ "tools": { "preset": "frontend" } }   // ~/.rivet/config.json or project .rivet-config.json
```

Core tools at a glance (included in minimal by default unless noted): bash · read · write · edit · apply_patch · grep · glob · ast_grep · diff · todo · plan · delegate_task · delegate_batch · web_search · web_fetch · ask_user_question · memory · skill · run_tests · git · job (background tasks); `council_convene` / `team_orchestrate` / `monitor` / `computer_use` / office tools are full-only.

### Goal-Driven Auto-Continue

/goal Refactor the authentication module to use async/await throughout
/cancel-goal   # stop early

GoalTracker integrates with the turn loop, doom-loop detection, and delivery gates; in goal mode the doom-loop threshold is loosened to allow deeper exploration.

### Plan Mode

Design-first workflow — produce a plan before touching code, avoiding the "just start editing" impulse-trap.

**Entering Plan Mode**: `/plan-mode` (toggle; run again to exit). Complex tasks are also auto-suggested for entry — controlled by `RIVET_PLAN_MODE_SUGGEST`: default `auto` (agent enters autonomously on multi-module / refactor / security-critical tasks, without asking), `ask` (ask the user first), `0`/`off` (disabled). While in Plan Mode, writes are locked except to the active plan file.

Once in Plan Mode, the agent does **not** modify code immediately. Instead it:
1. **Investigates** — reads relevant code, understands existing architecture and constraints (may dispatch parallel `code_scout` workers via `delegate_batch` to probe each module).
2. **Produces a plan** — a structured plan document (technical research, architecture diagram, task breakdown, verification plan), written to `.rivet/plans/<slug>.md`.
3. **Submits for approval** — the `plan` tool with `action=submit` lists key points and alternative paths, then waits for your confirmation.
4. **Approval & execution** — you inspect with `/plan-list`, approve and launch wave-based execution with `/plan-approve <slug>`, or reject with `/plan-reject <slug> <feedback>` to have the agent revise and resubmit.
5. **Closure** — `/plan-close <file> --tasks <range|all> [--preview]` marks task status (`--preview` previews without writing).

```
/plan-mode                          # enter/exit Plan Mode (toggle; exit needs double-confirm if unapproved)
/plan <feature>                     # generate a plan draft (writing-plans workflow)
/plan-list                          # list plans awaiting approval
/plan-approve <slug> [option]       # approve and start execution
/plan-reject <slug> [feedback]      # reject for revision (Plan Mode stays active)
/plan-close <file> --tasks <1-7|all> [--preview]   # close a completed plan
/plan-template                      # manage reusable plan templates
```

> There is also a read-only **Ask Mode** (`/ask` toggle): only read / search / `ask_user_question` are allowed — suited for code Q&A and requirement clarification; run `/ask` again to exit when you need to edit or run commands.

Plan Mode has built-in task-mode delegation — complex plans automatically call `delegate_task` to probe from multiple architecture perspectives (Tianquan / Yaoguang / Tianji / Tianfu / Tianxuan) in parallel; findings are tagged "to-be-verified" to prevent blind trust. The desktop app shows real-time checklist progress during plan execution.

### Rewind

Double-tap **ESC** (within 400ms) to open message history. Select any past user message to rewind the conversation to that point — agent state, tool history, and session metadata roll back cleanly. Choose from three restore granularities: **conversation only / code changes only / both**; code-related actions come with a precise preview of which files will be affected. Available in both TUI and desktop.

### Session Handoff & Resume

Long sessions accumulate context; past a point, starting fresh is cheaper than pressing on. Tianshu passes context losslessly across sessions via a handoff → resume loop that also preserves the prefix cache:

**Handoff `/handoff [note]`** — the agent writes a structured handoff doc to the in-project `.rivet/HANDOFF.md` (inside the workspace, no approval needed), then auto-archives it to `<id>.handoff.md` in the session dir after the turn. The doc is written for a **brand-new session with zero context**, in five fixed sections:

- **Objective** — a one-line goal in the user's own words + explicit non-goals
- **Done** — each item with evidence: changed files (`file:line`), verification commands run + results, commit hashes
- **Blocker** — where it's stuck, what's been ruled out, suspected causes
- **Next steps** — prioritized, each an immediately executable action
- **Pitfalls** — traps never to step in again, each with its consequence in one sentence

> When context usage hits ≥60%, you get a one-time nudge on the resume screen and mid-session: "run `/handoff` first, then start a new session" — the handoff doc auto-injects into the new session, saving prefix-rebuild cost versus replaying everything. Exit also notes cache cost (within TTL ≈ read-only cache price; expired = one full prefix rebuild). The desktop + menu has a "Handoff" entry.

**Resume `--continue` / `--resume` / `/resume`** — when restoring an existing session:

- **Auto handoff injection** — the previous session's `<id>.handoff.md` is fed to the new session via the `prev-session-handoff` appendix, so a zero-context session can pick up where it left off
- **Frozen-prefix inheritance** — the frozen snapshot is persisted with the session (every user boundary + on shutdown); on resume it's read back into the new engine — **no more byte-0 full miss**; the prefix only breaks at the next user boundary. Falls back to full rebuild only with no snapshot / corrupt file / expired provider cache
- **Write-evidence repair** — a preflight runs before resume, synthesizing orphan tool results lost to interruption (disk-probed write evidence), preventing the model from blindly rewriting files that already landed
- **Model affinity** — resume switches back to the original session's model (per-model cache namespace); explicit `--model/--provider` wins; if the original is unavailable, `agent.resumeFallbackModel` is the fallback
- **State restore** — side panel, todos, and the active plan all come back

```bash
tianshu --continue                 # resume the most recent session for this cwd
tianshu --resume abc123            # resume a specific session (short prefix OK)
tianshu --resume                   # open the session picker after startup
```

### Council (Multi-Perspective Review)

```
/council <objective>
/council <objective> --rounds 2   # enable rebuttal round
```

Convenes multiple expert seats to review a plan or design, producing an auditable Markdown plan with seat contributions and convergence state.

### Task Modes

A task mode (formerly "star domain"; `/domain` remains a working legacy alias) is an optional switch in how the agent works — not a role-play costume. Entering one really changes three things: the **system prompt** (the mode's methodology block), the **tool whitelist** (workers intersect with the mode's `toolWhitelist`), and the **decision threshold** (`courageThreshold` — Pojun 0.25 boldest, Taiyi 0.95 most deliberate, Yaoguang 0.7 evidence-demanding). New sessions start in **Daily development** and never switch on their own; setting the default mode to `auto` enables keyword-based routing from the task description (pool: Tianquan / Kaiyang / Yaoguang / Tianliang + custom modes; specialized modes such as Huagai and Taiyi are manual-only). Real-session behavior samples: [Observability Harness & Real Data](docs/reference/observability-harness.md).

```bash
/task-mode tianliang       # switch to "Execute the task"
/task-mode list            # list all modes
/task-mode                 # open the mode picker
/domain tianliang          # legacy alias (old command), still works
Implement user registration  # auto-routes to Tianliang
Review this design           # auto-routes to Tianquan
```

| Display name | ID | When to use | How it works |
|--------------|-----|-------------|--------------|
| **Project orchestration** | `tianshu` | Cross-module/cross-file changes, architecture trade-offs, concurrent tasks, work whose depth must be judged first | Build the global view before acting; split complex work into independently verifiable units and verify each; trust a one-level grep for structural facts, but read through to the implementation for mechanism claims; mirror existing patterns and check the blast radius before changing |
| **Explore new approaches** | `pojun` | Technology selection, feasibility checks, new-feature prototypes, unknown boundaries, cases where you must try one route before deciding | Validate the shortest path first and treat failure as boundary information; turn what you learn into reusable form; after three walls, change dimension; a claim of "done/tested" with zero tool calls is false-green — grep the real consumers first |
| **Maintain structure** | `tianfu` | Refactoring, structural rework of existing modules, stability and performance optimization, export/interface compatibility changes | Understand why the code was written this way before changing it; put load-bearing structure beyond the reach of the change; exports are promises — breaking one needs a migration plan; fail loudly on ambiguity; record out-of-scope fixes instead of fixing them in passing |
| **Execute the task** | `tianliang` | Implementation work with settled boundaries, landing a plan, fixing defects, adding tests | First check that the files and line numbers the plan cites still match reality, and follow reality; verify what you changed and commit it rather than accumulating; regression tests go RED→GREEN; for ≥4 units, split into waves and close each before starting the next |
| **Evaluate the plan** | `tianquan` | Reviewing plans and approaches, architecture trade-offs, verifying external docs/research, producing an executable plan document | Verify before weighing — never summarize without checking; present both ends: benefits and costs together; a one-level grep settles existence claims, but runtime semantics need a walk down the call chain with file:line citations; without implementation evidence, downgrade "revision" to "question" |
| **Check assumptions** | `tianji` | Premise audits after a plan takes shape, counterfactual reasoning, finding missed possibilities and hidden assumptions | List implicit premises and ask of each "what if it does not hold"; run the three-step reachability test to spot over-engineering; audit the plan's silences (subsystems unmentioned, paths uncovered); every challenge must land on "which line to read, which command to run" |
| **Cross-module analysis** | `tianxuan` | Cross-domain/cross-module pattern transfer, solving design problems with a changed viewpoint, root-cause backtracking when symptoms pile up | Gather fragments from three unrelated fields first so the pattern can emerge, and dispatch a counterproof for each insight (only insights expressible as code/tests count); when several independent fields point at one pattern, check whether the isomorphism is real; change entry point when the same viewpoint loops; verify before patching |
| **Improve prompts** | `fu` | Prompt/system-prompt tuning, methodology distillation, model behavior diagnosis, trade-offs in context and notice injection | Diagnose before editing, separating cognitive-field problems from model-capability ones; when distilling methodology, drop every entry lacking "action + criterion + counterexample"; do not erode boundaries between modes or create contradictory instructions; never touch static tool definition text — dynamic content goes through the volatile/appendix channel |
| **Tidy the code** | `wenqu` | Naming and structure cleanup, local refactors and de-noising, readability, UI/style implementation and tuning | Read the existing idiom first, then make the most restrained change so intent is self-evident; no redundant logic or over-abstraction; for UI changes start a dev server and screenshot with browser_debug, then re-check at another width |
| **Reconcile runtime results** | `kaiyang` | Performance and behavior measurement, instrumentation and reconciliation, simulation replay, investigations needing "measure first, then act" | Derive the exact composition before measuring against it; expected values come from an independent channel (spec/manual derivation/reference implementation/physical constraint), never from the system under test; change one variable at a time — a single point is not evidence |
| **Reproduce and verify** | `yaoguang` | Verifying claims (yours or others'), regression hunting, defect family grouping, checks for silently failing mechanisms | Ask first whether the original defect can be reproduced — RED→GREEN is the only evidence; trust exit codes and actual diffs, not commit messages; group a single bug into a family before fixing; when suspecting silent failure, install the ledger before changing behavior |
| **Follow long-running work** | `huagai` | Multi-wave long tasks, large refactors, continued fixes after a FAIL review, work that must resume across sessions | Do not say "done" before verifiable evidence, and keep fixing after a FAIL; build the measuring stick in the first wave and validate every later wave against the same one; state "explicitly not doing" during planning; run false-green detection |
| **Daily development** | `qiming` | Everyday feature work and bug fixing, exploratory investigation, research tasks that pave the way for others (default mode) | Run the full-picture deduction one step before acting, propose a precise architectural hypothesis and ground it in first-hand logs and code facts; fill gaps with tools or by asking their builders, never with a reasoning chain; cross-check key conclusions at least two independent ways |
| **Check UI and delivery** | `changgeng` | Delivery acceptance for UI changes, visual checks across themes/sizes, wrapping up and handing off long tasks | Screenshot the render with browser_debug before delivery, and again at another width when in doubt; visual acceptance is hard currency — multi-theme matrix (light/dark mandatory), pixel ground truth, before/after evidence; leave handoff notes, snapshots and archives judged by "can tomorrow's person continue directly" |
| **Trim the redundant** | `qisha` | Dead-code and redundancy cleanup, attention-budget accounting, retiring defenses and config, subtraction tasks needing an evidence-backed list | The burden of proof lies with the existing thing — ask only whether it can show it still works (has it fired? did behavior change when it did?), preferring already-persisted history; nominate, never execute; for anything you cannot cut, state what it is bearing; give each nomination a criterion and a rollback path |
| **Use a minimal toolset** | `taiyi` | Small changes with clear boundaries, convergent tasks needing restraint and focus, situations where fewer tools mean less drift (manual switch) | Let the question pause before acting; advance one thing at a time; at each stopping point leave the basis for your judgment, the hypotheses you rejected, and the forks you did not take; attribute causes to one reviewable observation (adjacent line, timestamp, on-disk evidence), not to inference from source |

> The display names above are the product-facing labels. Historical naming, founding memories and archived lore live in the [✦ Genesis Stele](docs/stars/genesis-stele.en.md) — an archive, not current usage documentation.

Council (`/council`) and team mode (`/team`) convene several task modes as seats and can enter a rebuttal round when opinions conflict.

### Skills System

Reusable workflow playbooks. `visual-acceptance` (frontend/UI change acceptance: screenshot diffing, render self-check, interaction walkthrough) ships bundled with the release; project-level skills load from `.rivet/skills/*.md`. Two-layer progressive disclosure: only name + description enters context; full instructions load on demand via the `skill` tool or `/skill`.

```
/skill visual-acceptance <your task>   # load and immediately run the skill
/skill off visual-acceptance           # stop re-injecting the skill instructions
```

Create a custom skill by dropping a `.md` file with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `triggers`) into `.rivet/skills/`.

> `writing-plans` / `executing-plans` are now built-in native flows (planning follows the system prompt's `<plan-mode>` discipline, execution the `<plan-executing>` discipline) — no skill files needed. `agent-harness-testing` / `research-spec` left the default distribution and are archived in [`docs/skills/optional/`](docs/skills/optional/) — copy them into `.rivet/skills/` to enable.

### Cross-Session Memory

Tianshu's project memory is stored in **`.rivet/knowledge/memory.jsonl`** (JSONL with atomic writes and a file lock); `memory-index.sqlite` is a rebuildable search projection.

| Capability | Details |
|------------|---------|
| **Write paths** | `memory remember` (project scope passes the end-of-session quality gate), post-action **auto-capture**, end-of-session **consolidation**, delivery-time **agent-crafted** entries, and user-written **`/remember`** |
| **Explicit recall** | `memory recall` (hybrid search over structured entries + `knowledge/*.md` + playbook lessons) and `memory deep_recall` (distills original text from past sessions; current and worker sessions are excluded) |
| **Automatic injection** | New sessions auto-carry relevant **governance/constraint/preference** memories only; old markdown docs and `failure_pattern`/`finding` entries stay recall-only |
| **Topic-switch isolation** | Explicit “resolved / different request” signals plus high-confidence intent-route topic changes switch the memory query, so short new questions are not hijacked by old-task memory |
| **Lifecycle** | `/remember <text>` writes directly; `/forget <entryId> [resolved]` invalidates a memory (resolved=old issue fixed, forgotten=remove it); invalidation is invalidate-don't-delete, keeping the original text auditable |
| **Data locations** | Cross-session knowledge lives in `<cwd>/.rivet/knowledge/`; session transcripts in `~/.rivet/sessions/<slug>/<id>.jsonl`; pheromones are **session-scoped** signals |

Key switches:

| Environment variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------------------|---------|---------|
| `RIVET_ADAPTIVE_MEMORY` | `on` | `on` injects relevant memory at session start; `shadow` evaluates only; `off` disables |
| `RIVET_MEMORY_AUTO_CAPTURE` | `on` | End-of-session LLM judgement of important operations → LTM |
| `RIVET_MEMORY_CONSOLIDATION` | `on` | End-of-session summary + reusable procedures |
| `RIVET_MEMORY_BACKFILL` | `off` | Opt-in idle backfill of historical session transcripts (idempotent ledger) |
| `RIVET_NO_CROSS_SESSION` | unset | `1` force-disables cross-session loading (memory blocks / events / presence) |

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)

Connect external tool servers — documentation search, databases, APIs — directly into the agent's tool pipeline. MCP servers auto-discover at startup; their tools appear as `mcp__<serverId>__<toolName>`.

```bash
tianshu config mcp add-stdio <server-id> npx -y <package> [args...]   # local process
tianshu config mcp add-sse <server-id> http://localhost:3001/sse      # remote/network
tianshu config mcp add-preset context7                                # popular preset
tianshu config mcp list                                               # list + status
```

Inside a session: `/mcp` (status) and `/debug mcp` (diagnostics). MCP tools respect the same approval mode as built-in tools.

### Terminal UI (TUI)

Tianshu's command-line interface runs on a purpose-built **T9 rendering engine** — pure ANSI, zero React/Ink dependency, pure TypeScript (`src/tui/engine/`). Beyond ordinary conversation and tool-call display, the TUI ships a set of interactions designed for coding workflows:

| Capability | Notes · Shortcuts |
|------------|-------------------|
| **GlanceBar status line** | A single line above the input box shows, in real time: task-mode glyph · git branch · model · reasoning effort · cache hit rate · context usage · this-turn cost · elapsed · turn count · todo badge. Session health at a glance. |
| **Mid-stream interrupt (Steer)** | Type while the agent is still running and press Enter to inject. Inputs queue at `now / next / later` priority and drain to the AgentLoop at tool-result or turn boundaries — no need to wait for it to finish. `halt`-style intents auto-promote to `now`. |
| **Message queue (/queue)** | `/queue <text>` explicitly queues a whole message while the agent is busy; queued items are delivered on settle, and an Esc interrupt refills them into the input box instead of dropping them. A live background-task bar and await area sit above the input. |
| **Inline terminal images** | Renders images right in the terminal via the kitty / iTerm2 graphics protocols (tool artifacts, screenshot verifications). Auto-detects the protocol; `RIVET_IMAGES=0` disables, `kitty`/`iterm2` forces one. |
| **@mention completion** | Type `@file:` / `@folder:` / `@symbol:` to trigger path completion (via `git ls-files`; supports the quoted form `@file:"a b.ts"` for paths with spaces). Pasting an image auto-converts to inline base64 (3-tier fallback across macOS/Linux/Windows). |
| **Rewind** | Double-tap `ESC` (within 400ms) to open message history; pick any past user message to rewind to, with three restore granularities (conversation only / code only / both) and a precise file-impact preview for code actions. See [Rewind](#rewind). |
| **Command palette** | `Ctrl+P` opens a fuzzy-searchable list of all slash commands and surface actions (toggle side panel, switch theme, enter Cockpit, etc.) — ↑/↓ to select, Enter to run, `Ctrl+P` again to close. Rebinds the original `Ctrl+Esc`, which Windows reserves for the Start menu and which legacy escape sequences cannot distinguish from plain Esc. |
| **Cockpit** | Open via the palette or `/cockpit <panel>`. An 8-panel fullscreen view — summary / trace / verify / context / safety / model / mcp / advisory — switch focus with ←/→/Tab. Real-time view of doom-loop level, delivery/verification status, cache + speculative pre-read stats, MCP connections, advisory lifts, etc. |
| **Multi-agent panels** | `/tasks` opens a fullscreen worker detail view (fusing the live view + JSONL transcript, with Contract/Activity/Result/Transcript sections and honesty labels); on wide terminals (≥100 columns), `Ctrl+]` toggles a right-side drawer showing the fleet tree, team-wave DAG, todos, and token gauge in real time. |
| **Themes & accessibility** | `/theme [name\|list]` switches palettes; the `auto` theme probes the terminal background via OSC 11 to adapt light/dark. Truecolor / 256-color / 16-color auto-downgrade. `/vim` toggles vim keybindings; `ui.reducedMotion: true` staticizes spinner and badge animation (accessibility). |
| **Welcome screen ("Datum Star")** | 3D TIANSHU wordmark + mission-line light sweep + entry hints (handoff / cache reminders). `RIVET_WELCOME_LOGO=pixel` switches to the dot-matrix logo (auto-fallback below 58 columns), `RIVET_WELCOME_ANIM=0` disables the sweep, `--skip-welcome` skips the page. |
| **Inline word-level diff** | Word-level highlighting inside changed lines — spot the real change in a long line at a glance. |

#### TUI keybindings

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Enter` | Send · `Shift+Enter` for newline |
| `Ctrl+C` | Three states: abort the current run while the agent is active; clear the input line when there's input; double-press within 2s when idle to exit |
| `Esc` | Close overlay / exit worker view; interrupt while the agent runs; toggle normal↔insert in vim mode; double-tap (<400ms) to rewind |
| `Ctrl+P` | Command palette (rebinds Ctrl+Esc, reserved by the Windows Start menu) |
| `Ctrl+]` | Toggle the right-side drawer (wide terminals) |
| `Ctrl+R` | History-search overlay (only when idle) |
| `Ctrl+O` | Expand/collapse the most recently truncated tool result |
| `Ctrl+T` | Collapse/expand the thinking (reasoning) block |
| `Ctrl+X` `r` | Leader key: `Ctrl+X` then `r` to open the right panel |
| `Ctrl+X` `t` | Leader key: `Ctrl+X` then `t` to expand the full todo review |
| `↑` | When the input box is empty and the queue has pending items, recall the most recent queued steer message for editing |
| `@` | Trigger file/folder/symbol completion (`Tab` cycles candidates; backspace deletes atomically) |
| `Ctrl+V` | Paste a clipboard image (auto-converts to inline base64) |
| `F1`–`F8` | Direct bindings for high-frequency commands: F1 /help · F2 /tasks · F3 /cache · F4 /cockpit · F5 /theme · F6 /model · F7 /permission · F8 /sessions |

The TUI is the CLI's default surface. The desktop app (Tauri) and the VS Code/Cursor extension share the same agent kernel, only layering visual interactions on top of the TUI — see the next section and the [VS Code extension docs](docs/VSCODE-EXTENSION-RELEASE.md).

### Desktop (Tauri)

The desktop app builds a visual interaction layer on top of the TUI's full capabilities:

- **Integrated terminal** — `⌘/Ctrl+J` or `` Ctrl+` `` opens an embedded terminal (xterm.js + Rust portable-pty); run commands without leaving Tianshu.
- **+ menu** — one-click access to Council ♟, Team ⬡, dispatch sub-agents, switch model, and pick a task mode (no need to type slash commands).
- **Reasoning-effort picker** — `/effort` (no args) pops an interactive panel; choose a tier (Auto/Max/High/Medium/Low/Off) with ↑/↓ and confirm with Enter.
- **Thinking timer** — shows real-time elapsed while the agent runs (e.g. "thinking · explore · 1m 23s"); turns red after 10 minutes to flag a possible stall.
- **@file preview** — files mentioned in messages are clickable; a right-side drawer shows the content with syntax highlighting and line numbers.
- **DeepSeek balance query** — the Insights panel shows the account balance and arrears status at the top (via the official API).
- **Custom Provider** — Settings → Connect model service → + Custom Provider, supporting any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (Ollama/vLLM/direct OpenAI); API key optional.
- **Theme Studio** — multiple custom theme libraries, 50-step undo/redo, per-token editing, and a wallpaper color engine (OKLCH clustering + contrast audit); ships the "Tianshu Quiet Cabin" dark theme; import/export supported.
- **Adaptive sidecar memory** — heap cap auto-tiers by machine RAM (8G→2G / 16G→4G / 32G→6G / 64G+→8G; override via `RIVET_SIDECAR_HEAP_MB`); machines with ≤8GB auto-enable the lean resource tier.
- **Watchdog auto-recovery** — auto-continues on boundary stalls; the desktop timeline shows recovery events (⟳ auto-recover / ⏹ quota exhausted).
- **Multi-session concurrency** — a tab bar manages multiple sessions, each with its own cwd + model + approval mode.
- **Feature panels** (left rail `⌘1…9` to switch): Mission Control (multi-session console), Inbox, Automations (scheduled tasks), Skills / Hooks management, Git / GitHub, Changes (diff review), Delegation (fleet tree & team-wave DAG), Cockpit.
- **Popout window** — pop a single conversation thread into its own window for multi-screen parallel work.
- **JobsDock / TodoDock** — a persistent background-task dock (expand logs / kill / open in terminal) and a cross-tab persistent todo dock.

#### Desktop shortcuts

`⌘/Ctrl+/` opens the shortcut cheatsheet (ShortcutOverlay) at any time. Core shortcuts:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `⌘/Ctrl+K` | Command palette |
| `⌘/Ctrl+N` | New session |
| `⌘/Ctrl+1…9` | Switch feature panel |
| `⌘/Ctrl+,` | Settings |
| `⌘/Ctrl+Shift+]` / `[` | Next / previous session tab |
| `⌘/Ctrl+W` | Close tab |
| `⌘/Ctrl+B` | Toggle sidebar |
| `⌘/Ctrl+Shift+B` | Toggle review panel |
| `⌘/Ctrl+J` · `` Ctrl+` `` | Toggle integrated terminal |
| `⌘/Ctrl+;` | SideChat (side question) |
| `⌘/Ctrl+.` | Zen mode |
| `⌘/Ctrl+O` | View-mode cycle (standard → verbose → summary) |
| `Shift+Tab` | Plan / Agent mode toggle |
| `Esc Esc` | Rewind (desktop time-travel) |

> The desktop app also has Cockpit, SideChat (⌘;), Rewind time-travel, themes/Glass/wallpaper, Mirror acceleration, and other exclusive features — see the [Desktop User Guide](docs/desktop-guide.md).

### 📱 Mobile Remote

Turn your phone/tablet into a second screen for Tianshu — sessions run on the computer while you watch progress and approve actions from your phone:

- **Enable**: Desktop **Settings → Network → Remote Access** (shows the LAN URL, access token, and a scan-to-connect QR code); or from the CLI side, start `tianshu serve` with `RIVET_SERVE_HOST=0.0.0.0` (plus `--mobile-dir` pointing at the desktop build output) to serve `/mobile` on the same port.
- **Connect**: open `http://<computer-LAN-IP>:3100/mobile` in your phone browser — scanning the QR auto-fills the token (the URL is then immediately cleaned to avoid leaking it); manual token entry also works.
- **What you can do**: session list (sessions with pending approvals pinned on top) → read-only live timeline for a session (same folding / auto-reconnect semantics as the desktop) → approval / plan / question cards + abort button. Sending messages is intentionally out of scope.
- **Security**: trusted LAN or tunnel only (Tailscale/SSH); in LAN mode the bearer token is the sole credential — treat it like a password; never port-forward to the public internet.
- Full setup and security trade-offs: [Remote Access Guide](docs/remote-access.md).

### 🎙️ Voice Input (Desktop)

The composer's microphone button supports voice input on **both macOS and Windows**. Recognition runs on a **local whisper.cpp engine** — offline and private (audio never leaves your device), with better accuracy than built-in system speech recognition for mixed Chinese/English speech.

**First-run guide**

- The first click auto-downloads the recognition model (tiny ~75MB, mirror-accelerated for CN networks). If you click before the download finishes, you'll see "Speech recognition failed (whisper-unavailable)" — just retry shortly after.
- macOS requests microphone permission on first use: click **Allow**. If denied by mistake, enable the app under **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Microphone**.
- On Windows, if permission is denied, allow the app under **System Settings → Privacy → Microphone**.

**Notes**

- Recognition is fully local; recordings never leave the device.
- Click once to start recording, click again to stop and transcribe.
- When the local engine is unavailable (e.g. model not downloaded), macOS falls back to the system speech recognizer; Windows shows a model-not-ready hint instead.
- For higher accuracy, switch to the base model (~244MB): pre-download with `desktop/scripts/fetch-whisper-runtime.js --with-base`.
- On restricted networks, set `RIVET_WHISPER_PROXY=http://proxy:port` to accelerate model downloads.


### 🎨 Image Generation (text-to-image)

Register an OpenAI-shaped text-to-image endpoint (SiliconFlow, OpenAI Images, …) and the agent gains a `generate_image` tool.

- **Dedicated slot `agent.imageGenModel`** — `provider.default` and `agent.defaultModel` stay **exactly as they are** (the prefix-cache anchor holds). Until you configure it, the tool never enters the tool list, so users who never enable it see zero difference.
- **Path back, not bytes**: images land on disk and only the local file path goes back into the conversation. **Base64 never enters the context** — nor the error messages.
- **Desktop**: Settings → Image Generation — endpoint registration, a **live test that really generates** (it spends one generation credit), and a dropdown of already-registered image models. **Takes effect in the current session immediately** after registering.
- The size field name is configurable (OpenAI sends `size`, SiliconFlow sends `image_size`) and common response shapes are auto-detected. ComfyUI's native API is not supported yet — it needs an OpenAI-compatible bridge plugin running locally.

Registration steps and parameters are covered under “Image generation” in [Model Configuration](#-model-configuration).

Switch providers inside a session with `/model <name>`.

```bash
tianshu config                          # interactive setup (TTY)
tianshu config setup codex --default    # Codex uses OAuth (browser login on first run)
tianshu config show
```

Or edit `config.json` directly (only overrides needed, defaults are deep-merged). Location: `~/.rivet/config.json` for the CLI (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\.rivet` on Windows); for the desktop app check Settings → Storage (portable builds use `TianshuData\.rivet` next to the exe):

```json
{
  "provider": {
    "default": "deepseek",
    "providers": {
      "deepseek": {
        "apiKey": "sk-xxx",
        "models": [
          { "id": "deepseek-v4-pro", "contextWindow": 1000000, "maxTokens": 384000 }
        ]
      }
    }
  },
  "agent": { "maxTurns": 50, "approval": "auto-safe", "crossSessionEnabled": true },
  "compact": { "enabled": true, "autoThreshold": 800000 }
}
```

### Vision (image understanding)

- Multi-modal primary models read images directly; otherwise configure an `agent.visionModel` bridge to describe images before the primary model sees them.
- Built-in vision models, the `/vision` discovery wizard, `ask_image` follow-ups, and desktop/TUI settings are covered in the [Vision Guide](docs/user-guide-vision.md).
- Images append at the tail of the conversation and **do not break the prefix cache**; unsupported images are reported, never silently dropped.

### Image generation (text-to-image)

- Dedicated slot `agent.imageGenModel` (desktop: Settings → Image Generation): register an OpenAI-shaped text-to-image endpoint (SiliconFlow, OpenAI Images, …) and the agent gains a `generate_image` tool.
- **Your working model and `provider.default` stay exactly as they are** — image providers are registered separately, and until one is configured the tool never enters the tool list (zero effect on the prefix cache).
- The size field name is configurable (OpenAI sends `size`, SiliconFlow sends `image_size`) and the common response shapes are auto-detected; results come back as a **local file path only — base64 never enters the context**.
- ComfyUI's native API is out of scope (a three-step submit-workflow → poll-history → fetch-`/view` flow); run an OpenAI-compatible bridge plugin locally first.

### Worker Routing (different models for sub-agents)

```json
{
  "workers": {
    "profiles": {
      "capable": { "provider": "codex", "model": "gpt-5.6-sol" },
      "cheap":   { "provider": "minimax", "model": "MiniMax-M2.7" }
    },
    "routing": { "code_edit": "capable", "repo_summarization": "cheap" }
  }
}
```

## Approval & Permissions

Three public tiers, all managed with `/permission`:

| Tier | Command | Behavior |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Request approval** | `/permission supervise` (alias `manual`) | Confirm every high-risk tool — maximum control |
| **Approve for me** (default) | `/permission auto [turns]` (alias `default`) | Auto-run low/no-risk tools; still confirm high-risk; optional checkpoint every N turns |
| **Full access** | `/permission unattended confirm` · `/yes` · `/yolo` | No approval prompts; existing deny rules and runtime self-protection still apply |

Quick reference:

```bash
/permission                 # interactive tier picker
/permission status          # current mode + rules
/permission allow/deny      # tool allowlist / blocklist
/permission bash allow/deny # bash prefix allowlist / blocklist
/yes [off] · /yolo [off]    # one-key Full access / back to Approve for me (persisted)
```

```bash
tianshu --dangerously-skip-permissions      # one-session Full access
tianshu config set-approval auto-safe       # persist the default tier
```

- Rules come in `[config]` (persisted) and `[session]` (current session) layers; `deny` always wins.
- **Full access** skips approval prompts but still honors existing deny rules and runtime self-protection — tool validation, path safety, sensitive-file refusal, evidence tracking, checkpoints, and delivery gates all stay on. It does **not** turn on the write sandbox.
- The write sandbox is **only requested when explicitly configured** (`RIVET_SANDBOX=1`), and whether it actually applies depends on the host: macOS/Linux get a real kernel write boundary, native Windows has no lightweight backend. Rollback is the safety net where no boundary exists.
- `auto-accept` is a legacy alias (wire value), not a fourth tier: it shows and behaves as **Approve for me**.
- Project trust: untrusted projects don't load hooks / project MCP, and security keys are stripped; manage with `/trust`.
- Full command list, rule precedence, path grants, Windows behavior, and troubleshooting: [Sandbox & Permissions Guide](docs/user-guide-sandbox-permissions.md).

## Slash Commands

## For Developers

### Tech Stack

Node.js 24 · TypeScript strict (`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`) · T9 ANSI rendering engine · tsup bundle · node:test + assert/strict

### Build & Test

```bash
npm run typecheck                                    # typecheck
npm test                                             # all tests (16,000+ cases)
npm run build                                        # tsup bundle + staged native/wasm payload
node dist/cli/entry.js                               # launch TUI
node dist/cli/entry.js -p "fix the typo"             # headless mode
```

### Extending

**Add a tool** — implement `ToolDefinition` + executor in `src/tools/`, register in `src/main.tsx`, add test in `src/tools/__tests__/`.

**Add a skill** — drop a `.md` file in `.rivet/skills/` with frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `triggers`).

**Add a slash command** — project-local `.rivet/commands/*.md` with `$ARGUMENTS` interpolation.

**Add a hook** — implement `PreToolUse | PostToolUse | UserPromptSubmit | PreCompact` handler, register via `HookRegistry`. Handlers are isolated — a broken hook never crashes the loop.

### Architecture

```
src/
├── agent/     Core loop: turn-orchestrator, tool pipeline, coordinator,
│              advisory-bus, goal-tracker, sensorium, immune system
├── api/       Streaming API client — DeepSeek, GLM, Codex OAuth, multi-provider routing
├── prompt/    Prompt engine — frozen prefix + delta appendix + volatile context layers
├── tools/     Tools — bash, edit, read/write, grep, glob, run_tests, git, delegate, ...
├── tui/       Terminal UI (T9 ANSI engine: scrollback, input controller, overlay, stream)
├── compact/   Three-layer semantic pruning + micro-compact + request-time collapse

└── search/    Semantic search (BM25 + embedding RRF fusion)
```

### Session Data

Session logs are stored outside the project under `~/.rivet/sessions/<project-slug>/`
(slug = dir name + cwd hash prefix), keeping them invisible to `glob`/`grep` and out
of the working tree. Override with `RIVET_SESSION_DIR`. Global config lives at
`~/.rivet/config.json`. Each launch gets a unique session ID, so multiple instances
run in parallel without interference.

## Safety

- **Path boundary enforcement** — glob/grep/diff reject `..` traversal; `validatePath` blocks escapes
- **Project trust gate** — an untrusted project does not get its `.rivet/hooks.json` loaded, project-config security keys are stripped, and MCP servers are not launched; manage with `/trust` (CLI `--trust` / `--untrust`)
- **Symlink cycle protection** — realpath + visited set
- **SSRF protection** — Per-hop DNS + private IP blocking on every redirect
- **Sensitive file rejection** — `.env`, `credentials.*`, `*key*`, `*token*` blocked from read/commit
- **Destructive command gate** — `rm -rf`, force push, `DROP/TRUNCATE` require explicit confirmation
- **Checkpoint + rollback** — Git checkpoint before first file modification each turn
- **File-level undo** — Versioned backups before every write/edit
- **Worker safety** — Timeout budget via AbortController, tool allowlist enforcement
